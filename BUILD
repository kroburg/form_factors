To build all project components several external dependencies are required.

To build on Linux or MacOS cmake is required.
To build qt_shell on Windows cmake is required also (because there are no premade project and solution files).
To build with CUDA algorithms nVidia CUDA Toolkit and CUDA Samples are required. Please notice that in current state it is not possible to compile code without CUDA support.

CUDA libraries has dependency on nVidia CUDA Samples. It is header only dependency on common includes (NVIDIA_CUDA-7.0_Samples/common/inc).

For Windows there are Visual Studio 2013 projects and solution provided. It may be required to alter Additional includes and libraries paths. To keep smooth experience consider to clone project into CUDA Samples hierarchy to ~/NVIDIA_CUDA-7.0_Samples/0_Simple directory.

CUDA MacOS build and functionality are not tested.
